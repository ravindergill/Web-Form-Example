Task
----
We would like a web-based form where the user can enter his name and surname. When the user submits the form, it will be
saved in a database table called "users" and a message "Your name has been stored successfully" will be displayed.

Implementation should:

-    use best practice approach

-    use Java only & spring-mvc (preferably 3+) & hibernate (preferably 3+)

-    preferably use sql server or mysql databases. Please hand-code all ddl (i.e. don't export the ddl).

-    use velocity/freemarker or jsp's to render html

-    the quality of the html / css code is important too. Please do a best effort on your html/css code.

-    don't use ANY code generator tool (i.e. roo) but maven is allowed and preferred.

-	 implement some unit tests for each piece of logic 

-    queue the dao write operations to a pool of 10 threads. Those background threads will actually store the user details in the database.

-	 write one or more unit tests to make sure the multi thread read / write is working correctly
 
Please provide:

1.    a zip file with all the source code and the database ddl. There should be a build script, preferably a maven pom file. No war file is required.
